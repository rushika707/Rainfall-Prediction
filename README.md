# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. The model leverages various meteorological features and applies a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether it will rain the next day.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
- Prediction and Performance Metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle (for model persistence)

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather data with multiple meteorological attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Uses visualization techniques to analyze trends and correlations.
3. **Model Training:** Implements a Random Forest Classifier and optimizes it using hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Evaluation:** Computes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5. **Predictions:** Uses the trained model to predict rainfall for new data.

## Results
- Model Accuracy: ~85%
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics for performance evaluation

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with Deep Learning models
- Improve feature engineering techniques
- Deploy model as a web service
